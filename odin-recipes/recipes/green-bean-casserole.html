     <h3>Description</h3>
     
     <p>All you need is just four ingredients:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Green beans</li>
        <li>Canned soup</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Frenc-fried onions</li>
     </ul>
     <p>To make it more appealing you can optionally use crumbled bacon, sautéed mushrooms or onions,
         garlic, Parmesan cheese and black pepper too, if you wish.</p>

         <h3>Steps</h3>

         <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the beans and soup in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until warm.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in half the cheese. Microwave until melted and well-blended.
            </li>

            <li>
                Transfer to a prepared baking dish. Top with fried onions and remaining cheese.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the onions are brown.
            </li>
         </ol>
